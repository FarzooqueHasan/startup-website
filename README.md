# 🚀 Innovexor — Reimagining Intelligence

A modern 5-page responsive startup website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to simulate a real-world product landing with working form submissions, backend integration, and live API data.

---

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- 📤 **Simulated Backend** using [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) — real HTTP POST requests on form submission
- 🗄️ **Simulated Database** using `localStorage` — saves user inputs locally in the browser
- 🔍 **Live API Integration** via Hacker News (GET requests with filter support)
- 🎨 **Creative & Professional Design** — Inspired by real startup UIs (Apple, OpenAI, Tesla)
- ✅ **Form Validation** + JavaScript Alerts + Redirect to Thank You page
- 📱 **Responsive Layout** with mobile-friendly design

- ✅ Submitted form data is also stored in the browser using `localStorage` under:
  - `contactSubmission`
  - `waitlistSubmission`
